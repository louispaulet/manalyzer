        "\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook demonstrates a simple gender classification task using a zero-shot learning approach. The objective is to classify sentences into three categories: sentences with a male subject üë®, sentences with a female subject üë©, and neutral sentences with an inanimate or non-gendered subject üîÑ.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use the Hugging Face Transformers library ü§ó to build a classification pipeline and leverage a pre-trained zero-shot classifier model. The classifier is then applied to a small dataset of sentences to evaluate its performance in determining the gender or neutrality of the subjects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, we compute a confusion matrix üìä to assess the accuracy of the classifier in this particular task, enabling us to understand its effectiveness in differentiating between male, female, and neutral subjects.\n",

        "Explore this notebook to learn how zero-shot learning can be applied to real-world classification tasks and achieve impressive results with minimal effort and data üåü.\n"
